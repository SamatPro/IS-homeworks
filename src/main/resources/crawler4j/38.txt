Photographers, photo editors, videographers, and multimedia producers of all levels are invited for membership in Diversify Photo, provided that they self-identify as a nonwestern or person of color, are actively working towards a career in editorial or commercial photography, and are available for freelance assignments and commissions. The database distinguishes between full members (approved assignment-ready photographers, generally with 3+ years of experience) and our up-and-coming “Up Next” members, who are working toward full membership. Membership is (and always will be) free for photographers. After each open call, we enlist a team of photography professionals to review each applicant, verifying that everyone in the database is assignment-ready. This vetting process is critical to establishing and maintaining trust with those who use our database to make hiring decisions by giving them the confidence to take a chance on new talent in the absence of a traditional personal recommendation.
